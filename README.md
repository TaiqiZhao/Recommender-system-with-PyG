# recommender-system-with-PyG
This repository is a part of the [Stanford CS224W](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) course project. Here we build a Light-GCN based graph neural network recommender system on [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) using PyG. We implement the LightGCN model described in the paper ["LightGCN: Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network for Recommendation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02126) by He, X. et al. published in 2020.
